    "tech",
    ["AI", "Content Creation", "Automation"]
);

// Add multiple pages at once
GPTIdeasHub.addMultiplePages([
    {
        title: "Sustainable Web Design",
        description: "Creating eco-friendly websites with minimal environmental impact",
        category: "tech",
        tags: ["Sustainability", "Web Design", "Green Tech"]
    }
]);

// Update existing pages
GPTIdeasHub.updatePage(1, {
    title: "Updated Title",
    description: "Updated description"
});

// Remove pages
GPTIdeasHub.removePage(101);
```
